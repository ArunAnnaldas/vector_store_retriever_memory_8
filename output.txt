 Assistant:
Sure! The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = C * 9/5 + 32. So if you input a temperature in Celsius, I can easily calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit for you. Just let me know the Celsius value you want to convert!

 User: Now add Kelvin support to the function we discussed.

 Assistant:
Great idea! To convert Celsius to Kelvin, you simply add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature. So the formula to convert Celsius to Kelvin is K = C + 273.15. I can easily modify the function to include support for converting Celsius to Kelvin as well. Just let me know if you want to convert a temperature to Kelvin instead of Fahrenheit!
